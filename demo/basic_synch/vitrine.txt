			       Light chaser
			       ============

				  Lights:

				1  2  3  4

			      
				  Buttons

				    <->


   This is a simple light-chasing demo, similar to the basic demo, but now
 with the vitrine and chaser modules synchronised. Compare the CPU usage with
 the basic non-synchronised demo, and you'll notice the difference.  You can 
also run/stop the plc loop with $./plc_stop and $./plc_run on another terminal.

		       Controls (from the keyboard)
		       ----------------------------
      - L and R - toggle the `left' and `right' points. Remember to
	toggle them off again before trying the other direction :-)
      - Q - toggles the `quit' point, which terminates the demo.
