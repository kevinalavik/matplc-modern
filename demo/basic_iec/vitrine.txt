				  Lights:

				  Buttons

   This is a simple light-chasing demo, controlled from the keyboard. By
intention, this demo requires no hardware or setup - not even X or svgalib.
 Unlike the basic demo that uses a c program to do the light chasing, this
 version has the chaser written in ST or IL, which as then compiled by our
              iec compiler into a MatPLC binary module.

		       Controls (from the keyboard)
		       ----------------------------
      - L and R - toggle the `left' and `right' points. Remember to
	toggle them off again before trying the other direction :-)
      - Q - toggles the `quit' point, which terminates the demo.
