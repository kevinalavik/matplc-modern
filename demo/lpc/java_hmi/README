README - matd demo

Last Updates May 10, 2002

------------------------------------------------------------------------
About:

This directory contains a configuration and utilities for testing the
matd process that allows remote access the the MATplc. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use:

1. Run './setup' so that you can set up a user account.
2. Add a new account with a name of your choosing. NOTE: For now there is a
   demo user/password of test/test. This WILL be removed in later distributions
   but if you plan to put this on a computer on the net, you should change it NOW.
3. Edit the account and set the password.
4. Also set the read, write and execute permissions all to 3. This
   is the least secure setting, but is suitable for this demo.
5. Dump the accounts and verify the settings.
6. Save and quit. You should now have a user account defined in
   the 'passwd' file.
7. Run the matd server with './demo'.
8. In another window connect to the matd with 'telnet localhost 1234'. If
   you get a report of 'localhost' unknown use '127.0.0.1' instead. You can
   change the port number from '1234' to something else in the 'matplc.conf' file.
9. Enter your user name and password using 'USER xxxxx' and 'PASS xxxxx'.
10. Use 'HELP' to determine what commands are available.
11. Have fun.

Todo:
- This is the first prototype with very few function. The functionality can be expanded later.
- I hate plain text passwords, later this can be converted to something better.
