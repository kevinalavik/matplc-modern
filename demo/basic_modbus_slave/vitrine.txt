   This is a simple light-chasing demo, controlled from the keyboard. The
  lights you see are available on a modbus slave (by default-> modbus RTU,
     slave id=0, on output bits 1-4, /dev/ttyS1 serial port, 9600 baud,
                 no parity, 8 data bits and 2 stop bits)

		       Controls (from the keyboard)
		       ----------------------------
      - L and R - toggle the `left' and `right' points. Remember to
	toggle them off again before trying the other direction :-)
      - Q - toggles the `quit' point, which terminates the demo.
