This is a simple light-chasing demo, controlled from the keyboard. No
special hardware required. The lights are dislayed on a tcl based GUI,
instead of a the text based interface used in the basic demo.
It's controlled using the 'Left' and 'Right' buttons on the GUI.


Before running the demo you must first compile and install the tcl
extensions under the /lang/tcl directory. Please follow the
instructions in /lang/tcl/README


To start the demo:
	cd demo/basic_tcl; make

To quit:
	press 'Exit' on the GUI



The Chaser module (chaser.c) is a primitive `light chasing' program. The
direction of movement can be changed using the `left' and `right' points;
these are notionally push-buttons, but in this demo they are controlled by
the 'Left' and 'Right' buttons on the GUI. The speed of the chaser can be
configured with the "delay" setting in the "Chaser" section of matplc.conf

The demo terminates when the `quit' point comes on ('Exit' button).


Notes:
	- `demo' itself should be done in a generic fashion, rather than by
	  hard-coding all the modules; every program will need something to
	  start up all the modules at the beginning and shut them all down
	  at the end (perhaps giving them time to shut themselves down if
	  they want to).
