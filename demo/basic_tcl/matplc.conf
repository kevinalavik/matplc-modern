# These are also specified in the PLC section. However, it's not specified
# whether they are inputs or outputs here - that should be specified in the
# section(s) relating to the I/O modules. (That way, a point can be both an
# input and an output, or it can be output in several places. Also, some
# points are just internal coils and don't get input or output at all.)

# name      = Name used to refer to the point throughout the PLC
# full name = More extensive description of the point
#             This might be displayed by various diagnostic tools.
# owner     = Name of the module with write permission on the point
# at        = 'at' identifier
# offset    = location of word in the globalmap that holds the point's state
# bit       = the bit in the word (0-31), that holds the point's state
