This is a simple light-chasing demo, controlled from the keyboard. No
special hardware required.

To start:
	cd demo/basic; make

To quit:
	press `Q' on the keyboard


It's controlled from the keyboard (module Kbd, kbd.c): the keys L, R and Q
on the keyboard toggle the three points `left', `right' and `quit'.

The Chaser module (chaser.c) is a primitive `light chasing' program. The
direction of movement can be changed using the `left' and `right' points;
these are notionally push-buttons, but in this demo they are controlled by
the L and R keys. The speed of the chaser can be configured with the
"delay" setting in the "Chaser" section of matplc.conf

The demo terminates when the `quit' point comes on (keyboard Q).


Buglet (now only one):
	- assumes a linux terminal (hard coded escape codes).

Notes:
	- kbd.c should eventually be replaced by a proper HMI thing.
	- `demo' itself should be done in a generic fashion, rather than by
	  hard-coding all the modules; every program will need something to
	  start up all the modules at the beginning and shut them all down
	  at the end (perhaps giving them time to shut themselves down if
	  they want to).
