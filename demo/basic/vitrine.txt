   This is a simple light-chasing demo, controlled from the keyboard. By
intention, this demo requires no hardware or setup - not even X or svgalib.
 That's why it looks the way it does - see the other demo directories for
		     more impressive demonstrations...

		       Controls (from the keyboard)
		       ----------------------------
      - L and R - toggle the `left' and `right' points. Remember to
	toggle them off again before trying the other direction :-)
      - Q - toggles the `quit' point, which terminates the demo.
