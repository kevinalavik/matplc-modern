This is a simple light-chasing demo, controlled from the keyboard, in which
the matplc points reflecting the state of the lights are copied onto
the cif card's output process image, and from there to whatever hardware
you may be using...

Remember that the cif module requires that the cif device driver (i.e. the cif
kernel module) be loaded. Change into drivers/cif and unzip
the kernel device driver version 1.003 for kernels 2.2.x, or driver
version 2.000 for kernels 2.4.x.
Find the cif_load executable file, and run it as root to install the 
device driver.
After having configured the cif card, you are then ready to run the demo.

To start:
	cd demo/basic_cif; make

To quit:
	press `Q' on the keyboard


It's controlled from the keyboard (module Kbd, kbd.c): the keys L, R and Q
on the keyboard toggle the three points `left', `right' and `quit'.

The Chaser module (chaser.c) is a primitive `light chasing' program. The
direction of movement can be changed using the `left' and `right' points;
these are notionally push-buttons, but in this demo they are controlled by
the L and R keys. The speed of the chaser can be configured with the
"delay" setting in the "Chaser" section of matplc.conf

The demo terminates when the `quit' point comes on (keyboard Q).


Buglet:
	- assumes a linux terminal (hard coded escape codes).
