   This is a simple light-chasing demo, controlled from the keyboard. The
lights you see are available (inverted) as TTL outputs on pins 6-9 of the DB25 
parallel port connector. 

		       Controls (from the keyboard)
		       ----------------------------
      - L and R - toggle the `left' and `right' points. Remember to
	toggle them off again before trying the other direction :-)
      - Q - toggles the `quit' point, which terminates the demo.
