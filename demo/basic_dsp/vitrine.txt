Time     (f32):

   This is a simple PID controller demo. It uses several of the blocks of the
dsp module to implement a closed loop PID controller. Use the 0 to 9 keys to
change the value of the 'Leader' and whatch the 'Follower', controlled by
the PID loop, follow the 'Leader'.

		       Controls (from the keyboard)
		       ----------------------------
      - 0 to 9 - Change the value of the Leader.
      - Q - toggles the `quit' point, which terminates the demo.
