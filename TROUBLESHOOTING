                      Trouble Shooting
                      ================

Known problems and fixes are documented below. There may also be
suggestions in sub directories. If you find a problem with no known
solution, please let us know (mat-devel@lists.sf.net).


1. Problem: 'make all' finishes with an error complaining that it can't
	    find comedilib.h or gtkplot.h

   Solution #1: You don't have the comedi development files (comedilib.h)
		or the gtk extra development files (gtkplot.h). Install
		them. On Debian, that's libcomedi-dev and libgtkextra-dev

	    #2: Comment the mmi/hmi_gtk/all or io/comedi/all out of the
		main Makefile.

		The comedi module is only useful if you have a comedi
		device, so this may be the best solution.

		The hmi_gtk module is needed by some of the demos; but you
		can do without it if it's a problem. You'll have to avoid
		any of the demos that have a graphical interface.


2. Problem: When compiling a demo with 'make' I get an error that says
            'could not compile linuxkbd.o'.

   Solution #1: Some of the demos use a replacement program called
                'kbd.o', and you will be able to run the program. Other
                demos have not been changed to use it and they will fail.
                The 'basic' demo will work without it now. 

            #2: You can download and install 'console tools' and this
                >may< solve the problem.


3. Problem: I run the 'basic' demo, and all I get is a blank screen. The
            only way to stop it is to hit [CNTL]C. This is caused by
            POSIX timer functions that are not implemented completely or
            at all in older Linux distributions.

   Solution #1: In the file 'lib/period/period.c' comment out the
                'SPIFFY_NEW_POSIX' definition, and uncomment the
                'GOOD_OLD_UNIX' definition. If you do this some demos
                may not work, and the 'sleep' function can't be used.

            #2: Upgrade the 'glibc' libraries, or load a newer Linux
                distribution. Slackware 8.0 and Redhat 7.1 are recent
                enough.


4. Problem: When trying to compile the PLC there is an error in the
            'lib/period' directory. This is caused by the use on newer
            POSIX timer functions that may not be implemented on older
            Linux distributions.

   Solution #1: In the file 'lib/period/period.c' comment out the
                'SPIFFY_NEW_POSIX' definition, and uncomment the
                'GOOD_OLD_UNIX' definition. If you do this some demos
                may not work, and the 'sleep' function can't be used.
                If it still won't compile use the 'NO_TIMERS' option.
                This will get the demos to run, but they may not work
                correctly.

            #2: Upgrade the 'glibc' libraries, or load a newer Linux
                distribution. Slackware 8.0 and Redhat 7.1 are recent
                enough.
