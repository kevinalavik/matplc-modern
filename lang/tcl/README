This TEA-compliant loadable Tcl extension implements commands for
interacting with the MatPLC.  The form and structure of this extension
were derived from the sample TEA extension (sha1).

The code was developed in a Tcl 8.3 environment, but should work with
any version version that supports Tcl stubs (versions >= 8.2)

The code was written using 3-space tabs and the indentation convention I'm
most comfortable with, for which I make no apologies.

This remainder of this file explains how to build and install the extension.
The Tcl command(s) implemented by the extension are described in MANUAL, and
known bugs are described in BUGS.

The following build and installation procedure is known to work on a Mandrake
7.2 system, and known to have problems on a Debian potato system.
(The problem encountered is described at the end of this README.)

To build the module:

1. Install the code in the MatPLC source tree.

2. Make sure the MatPLC library (matplc.a) has been built,
and is located in the MatPLC lib directory.

3. Verify that the Makefile.in specifies a valid path to the MatPLC root
directory.  If this code is installed in a second-level subdirectory of the
MatPLC source tree (i.e. lang/tcl), then Makefile.in already specifies
the correct relative path (../..).

4. autoconf

5. ./configure

6. make


To install the module:

7. make install

By default, this installs the extension in the /usr/local/lib directory.
If you want it installed elsewhere, invoke ./configure with the appropriate
directory specified (i.e. --exec-prefix=).

If you install in /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/lib is not in the default
auto_path for your Tcl interpreter (tclsh or wish), then you will need to
execute the following line

	lappend auto_path /usr/local/lib

before invoking

	package require lplc


Problems:

At least one user encountered problems building the package on a Debian
(potato) system.  The autoconf failed to find the tclConfig.sh file, and
therefore failed to properly create the configure script.  Once that was
worked around, the Makefile built the shared library with a .so.1 extension,
rather than simply .so, which caused the mk_pkgIndex to fail.

If you encounter problems building the system, or if you know how to solve
the problems described, please email the MatPLC mailing list
(matplc@matplc.org) and/or Greg Goodman (chironsw@swbell.net).
