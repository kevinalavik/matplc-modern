README - email

Last Updates Feb, 7, 2003

--------------------------------------------------------
About:

This is a module that will send email to a remote client

-------------------------------------------------------- 
Notes:

- This process should only ever be called 'email'. And it should be run as a 'NORMAL' process with low priority because of the slow nature of the internet. email messages are send by sending a realtime message to the process with the format 'destination~subject~filename', where,
    destination = the email address to send to
    subject = the subject name for the email
    filename = the name of a file that contains the text to send in the body of the message. If the file doesn't exist the filename is sent instead.
Note: be careful not to use any tildes '~' in the message, as these will be interpreted as delimeters and errors will occur.

--------------------------------------------------------
Bugs:

	- none known

--------------------------------------------------------
Todo:

	- make robust for other mail server types
	- the source of the message is left as a dummy source for now. Eventually this should be made an actual source. When the IP address of the source was being sent it was being rejected by the mail servers.

--------------------------------------------------------
History:

Feb 7, 2003 (Hugh) - changed the email source'
May 31, 2002 (Hugh Jack) - rewritten so that it would use the process handler
