About:

This is a simple text based HMI that will display PLC points on the screen.

Notes:

	- this uses two files 'vitrine.txt' for a background, and 'vitrine.conf' for the mapping from the LPCL to screen items.
	- if it doesn't exit normally the screen can be returned to normal with the 'reset' command.

Bugs:
	- none known

-------------------------------------------------------
Todo:

	- don't have any ideas right now.
