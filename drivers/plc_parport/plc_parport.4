       ppllcc__ppaarrppoorrtt[0-2] are  character devices  for direct access
       to the  parallel port;  they  have a major number  240 and
       minor  numbers  0-2. Usually  they have  mode 666  and are
       owned by root and group root.
       If the driver  is built into  the kernel, it may be confi-
       gured using:
       plc_parport={parportx | none}[, ...]
       Where the  minor number(s) will be bound to the correspon-
       ding parport. Ex.:
       plc_parport=parport0,none,parport1
       will bind  minor number  0 to parport0,  leave minor 1 un-
       bound, and bind minor number 2 to parport1.
       If the driver is loaded as a module, similar functionality
       is available  using module  parameters. The  equivalent to 
       the above would be:
       # insmod plc_parport parport=0,none,1

       Writing to a device  controlled by  this driver will write
       the bytes directly to the  parallel port. Reading from the
       device  will read  directly  from the  parallel  port. The
       byte in position 0 of the  virtual file is mapped onto the 
       D register, while bytes 1 and 2 are  mapped onto the S and
       C registers respectively.
