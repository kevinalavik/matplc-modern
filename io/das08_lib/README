About:

This is a program that will map keystrokes to points in the PLC memory. Right now it is only configured for the chaser demo.


ARGUMENTS:
the argument for this function is a filename containing configuration parameters. The file may contain comments on lines starting with '#', blank lines are also permitted. The contents of the file are shown below.

Bn		- This will set the base address of the card to 'n'
A0BIP10VOLTS	- define analog output 0 to be -10 to +10V
A0BIP5VOLTS	- define analog output 0 to be -5 to +5V
A0BIP2PT5VOLTS	- define analog output 0 to be -2.5 to +2.5V
A0BIP1PT25VOLTS	- define analog output 0 to be -1.25 to +1.25V
A0BIPPT625VOLTS	- define analog output 0 to be -0.625 to +0.625V
A0UNI10VOLTS	- define analog output 0 to be 0 to +10V
A0UNI5VOLTS	- define analog output 0 to be 0 to +5V
A0UNI2PT5VOLTS	- define analog output 0 to be 0 to +2.5V
A0UNI1PT25VOLTS	- define analog output 0 to be 0 to +1.25V
A1BIP10VOLTS	- define analog output 1 to be -10 to +10V
A1BIP5VOLTS	- define analog output 1 to be -5 to +5V
A1BIP2PT5VOLTS	- define analog output 1 to be -2.5 to +2.5V
A1BIP1PT25VOLTS	- define analog output 1 to be -1.25 to +1.25V
A1BIPPT625VOLTS	- define analog output 1 to be -0.625 to +0.625V
A1UNI10VOLTS	- define analog output 1 to be 0 to +10V
A1UNI5VOLTS	- define analog output 1 to be 0 to +5V
A1UNI2PT5VOLTS	- define analog output 1 to be 0 to +2.5V
A1UNI1PT25VOLTS	- define analog output 1 to be 0 to +1.25V
PAI		- Set port A as input
PAO		- Set port A as input
PBI		- Set port B as input
PB0		- Set port B as input
PCO		- Set all of port C as output
PCI		- Set all of port C as input
PCLI		- Set port C low nibble as input
PCLO		- Set port C low nibble as output
PCHI		- Set port C high nibble as input
PCHO		- Set port C high nibble as output



-------------------------------------------------------- 
Notes:

- The counter functions are not available yet, although they are implemented in the code.
- There is a test program 'testdas08' that can be used to perform some basic commands with the board. The program also loads the configuration file, so it can be used to verify syntax. etc.
- Right now this must be run as ROOT. This can be fixed by creating a module driver that is properly installed.

--------------------------------------------------------
Bugs:

- none known

--------------------------------------------------------
Todo:


- the driver is functional and has been tested with the auxilliary ports, and for analog IO.
- the counter functions have not been tested, and they are not available to the LPC code yet.
- many of the possible variations for the settings have not been implemented.

History:

April 23, 2002 (Hugh Jack) - rewritten so that it would use the process handler
