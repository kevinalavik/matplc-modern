* 1 Add support for multi-bit matplc points. For example, allow a 4 bit
    point to be mapped onto D0-D3 with the simple config line
    map out matplc_4_bit_point D0

    The code automatically finds the length of the matplc point and does
    all the rest. At the moment it assumes all points are 1 bit long.
