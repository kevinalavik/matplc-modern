* -> Done


 Postponed for version 0.2
 -------------------------

 7) Use a typedef for the type of var returned
    by plc_get_pt (and how they are stored in the
    memory maps) instead of explicitly using u32.
    Every reference to the number of bits in these
    variables must be changed to sizeof(XXXX)*8
    instead of assuming 32 bits. This will allow
    future migration to larger/smaller sized
    points without having to significantly change
    the source code.

 9) ****   U R G E N T   ****
    Must discuss what semantics to support for online
    configuration changes!!! How to propagate
    changes to every module. Maybe have the smm
    register the pid of the modules that call
    plc_init() and issue a signal to each module
    when the configuration changes.
    This is also related to item no. 17

 12) Add function plc_pt_name(plc_pt_t p)
     to gmm.h

*15) Should we go ahead and implement the --PLCremote option?
     NO!!

 17) plc_init should check whether the configuration in
     the confmap is really what has been defined in the
     matplc.conf file.
     This is also related to item no. 9

 24) Remove fflush from the plc_log_xxxmsg() functions. It's only there
     to guarantee that all messages are logged in the correct order when
     the three file descriptors point to the same file. Replace this
     with explicitly checking if the file is the same and then use the
     same file descriptor. Only do fflush in plc_log_done().
     NOTE: fflush also guarantees the order of logging for modules
           running in different processes. Do we still want to do fflush?
           Probably not. If we want to guarantee order maybe the syslogd
           does that?

 31) Write a front-end interface to access the config file parser. This will
     allow other people to write XML, SQL, and what not parsers to the
     plc. I (Mario) don't really like the conffile_xxxx() names of the
     current interface anyway. This will also come in usefull when we
     store a pre-parsed config file and boot from that (for very small,
     embeded?, MatPLCs)

 42) get the logging library to log milliseconds

 48) Have the cmm use a many readers/one writer locking mechanism to control access
     to the cmm block memory list. Currently it uses a single semaphore for global
     access to the memory list.

*49) Use better memory allocation policy in cmm!
     Currently, free'ing cmm memory blocks simply marks them as
     free'd. We need to get some algorithms to try an re-use
     this memory. Most important of all, we must try and join free'd
     memory blocks into a single larger memory block!


 To fix before version 0.1
 -------------------------

 4) ****   U R G E N T   ****
    plc_get() and plc_set() must not exit(1)

 10) Remove unnecessary #includes from .c files.

*16) Is the command line option --PLCid really required?
     Since we have every module reading the same matplc.conf
     file, this PLC_ID could be defined there.
     NOTE: Yes, currently it is required for --PLCisolate, unless we
     define a new plc_init() function that allows explicit passing
     of the plc_id.

 20) The conffile_done() function does not yet free
     malloc'ed memory.

 23) Go through all the smm code and change it so it
     uses the logging module.

 30) Make the smm_setup() and smm_shutdown() functions more intelligent.
     smm_setup() must not give up loading points if no config file is found.
     (Actually it is the conffile_lib that is exiting exit(1)!! This must be
     fixed.)
     smm_shutdown() must also use the parameters in the config file to
     give out warnings and try to shutdown a partially shutdown plc.
     (partially done - we still need to store the smm semaphore set key
     - and not the id - in shm_t to be able to use the key in the config file.)

 34) Launching of modules produces inconsistent log. This happens because
     created process closes the log files while parent process keeps them
     open.

 35) Synch_setup() must check for duplicates of places, transitions, synchpts,
     in the config file.

 38) Move gmm_init(), gmm_done(), synch_init(), synch_loop_beg()... declarations
     from public interfaces to protected interfaces.

*40) Implement functions to allow modules to get the lenght, bit and offset
     of a point handle. This will allow fixing the smm-mgr -d list of points.
       -> see gmm/gmm.h function plc_pt_details()

 43) allow the logging library to be configured in the config file.

 44) Move the data structures handling code from the synch library
     to the misc/ds_util.c file

*45) Remove hardwired references to "matplc.conf" from the *.c files

*46) Finish the period library. Have it use signals to guarantee the
     periodicity, instead of using sleep()

*47) cmm_free() is working (not the best of implementations, but will do for now).
     All the code that required this function must now call it! Must review all
     the code and call this function where required! Note that in most places,
     the function call is already there, just commented out!
