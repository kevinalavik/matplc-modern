Postal: Saginaw, MI
Maintains: AB Ethernet driver and utils (primary)
Background: Current job title "Electrical Engineer". Linux/Unix hacking
	(some SCO, some HP/ux). Machine tool design, programming, debug and
	installation. Programmed several AB PLC2, PLC5, and Pyramid
	Integrators. Also played with an AB ControlLogix. Current
	assignment has me in a Modicon plant so you could say that I am
	well rounded, PLC wise.  As for computer hacking, I have been doing
	that since the days of the old Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 1. One of
	my most popular hack back then was to add the ability to get a file
	directory displayed on the screen from inside BASIC without leaving
	BASIC (I hacked a hidden command within the interpreter). I have
	also dabbled in PC board design as a hobbyist - I have no designs
	on copper - yet. I also am very active in my region of the world as
	a Linux Advocate. I am also the co-founder of my local Linux Users
	Group. Other, lesser known projects of mine include a library and
	utility set for reading Dallas Semiconductor 1-wire temperature
	sensors (DS-1820) and a still in development interface program for
	use with the Fluke ScopeMeter 123. Future planned projects include
	a Modbus/TCP driver for Linux. I am very well versed in several
	operating systems (except VMS). I am also a very highly skilled
	PLC/PC programmer (but no windows, please). I don't mind taking
	design risks for the sake of breaking new territory, hense my
	affiliation with Linux in general. Nothing ventured, nothing
	gained.

Maintains: requirements document (proposed)
Background: Current job title "Sr. Electrical/Control Engineer/Consultant,
	Mitek Corp". I have designed, implemented, and installed automation
	systems for steel and aluminum industry clients around the world. I
	was on the GE Directo-matic 2000 design team (Multi-bus II based
	PLC controller) where I helped plan the architecture and designed
	and implemented a RLD editor. I have been an advocate of the use of
	finite state machines in control system software since the early
	80s. I have recently completed a long term contract with Kaiser
	Aluminum where I assisted in the design and implementation of a
	Linux based control system architecture that is to be used to
	replace aging MODCOMP and other legacy systems. I have a solid
	knowledge of C, SFC, RLD, FBL, ASM86, VMS, QNX, GE DMC. I have a
	working knowledge of Python, XML, and C++. I am new to the linux
	kernel but I have a couple of experts who are willing to give me
	lessons as necessary. I have been formulating a vision of the
	ultimate automation platform for nearly 20 years. I succeed in
	deploying a little more of my vision on each new project. During
	this time I have had the opportunity to work closely with fellow
	engineers, managers, operators, and technicians. Over the years I
	have refining my vision so that it more completely addresses the
	needs ad desires of the above folks.  I would like to share as much
	of this vision as is useful to this project.

Name: Ralph McDonald
E-mail: ralphm@spicergroup.com
Background: Current Title: Project Manager / Electrical Engineer at Spicer
	Group. My department is responsible for engineering electrical and
	control systems for Water, Wastewater, and Industrial systems.
	Besides being department supervisor I program and troubleshoot
	programmable controller systems for our clients. Mostly AB SLC and
	Opto22 at present. Still some legacy AB 2 & 5, GE Series Six and
	Square D systems also. First PLC was a 5TI back in late 70's. First
	computer was a Heathkit 6800 microprocessor trainer that I learned
	assembler on and later expanded. Hacked a TRS80CC (6809) to expand
	to 2 banks of 32k RAM each plus rom and rom pak address. Later
	wrote my own Forth for the TRS80CC. First computer program I actual
	got paid to write was in assembler for a Rockwell AIM 65 that was
	made into an automated electronic meter communications checker for
	Dow Chemical metering department. Did some programming for the
	Macintosh in assembler (as Macintosh Certified Developer). Wrote
	Forth program language reviews for "MacGuide" before they went
	belly up. As a Navy reservist in NMCB-26 helped maintain computer
	systems and train operators. Programming experience for AB PLC 2
	through SLC 5/05, GE series 6, Square D, Opto 22, Campbell
	Scientific Data Loggers and (Modicon - no recent experience ). HMI
	programming experience mainly with Intellution and OptoDisplay.
	Computer programming experience in Forth plus some assembler for
	6800, 6809, 6502, and 68000. Master Electrician License and
	Professional Engineers registration in Michigan.
Contributions: I am afraid not a lot at first. Because I have no practical
	C or C++ coding background and have just recently started on Linux
	at my oldest son's suggestion. I may be able to offer perspective
	as a potential used and specifier. Also I may have a client who
	would let me run a small system in parallel with an existing system
	at a wastewater pumping station for evaluation. It is a very
	interesting project, and I will be lurking around.

Background: Current job title "Chief Architect - Software, Control
	Technology Corporation" (blush) (translates to main techie :-)).
	Linux use, web development and admin 1 year, Quickstep design and
	development on Windows 7 years, Unix software development 9 years
	(programming tools, parallel Lisp, office automation), VMS 5 years
	(OS performance evaluation and Vax Lisp development), other stuff
	before that 6 years. Member of X3J13 (Common Lisp standard). My
	Linux experience is limited, but my Unix experience is rather more
	extensive and part of it was in a company with a very strong real
	time component (Encore/Gould). A general software guy with emphasis
	on programming tools and languages. Seen the progress, crash and
	continuation of many software bandwagons. Doesn't believe any one
	solution or tool is best for everything. Pragmatic technophile. My
	control experience is limited to Quickstep and Control Technology
	Corp. which is a rather different perspecive than much of this
	group. I eventually hope to make our perspective workable in this
	space, but think its more important that SOMETHING work first.
Contributions: Facilitating this project with Linux and web resources. Hope
	to be able to provide language and tools coding support later (but
	not from an AB or RLL perspective). Very interested in seeing this
	project succeed whether or not is produces something that works
	with Control Tech's approach to automation control.

Background: Current job title "System Administrator, MMI Design /
	Programming, Network Design / Implementation, Tech support" (yes, I
	do all those jobs and more. I don't have a 'title' that fits me
	anymore). MMI Design & Programming - 6 years using Wonderware,
	WinView, RSView, etc. PLC Programming - A couple.  Micro 1, AB PLC
	2 & PLC 5. While I don't normally program, I do help with
	troubleshooting and being a soundboard - if you include that, I
	also know pleanty about Modicon, and older Siemens processors.
	Programming - VB/VBA (VBA for office automation tasks), C/C++, 6802
	Assmebly (don't ask me to do it, it's been too long!), Perl, and
	some more obscure languages. Experience with just a little bit of
	everything from office automation stuff to low level OS stuff. Open
	Source Projects: Currently I'm involved in (x) Open Source projects
	if I count this one: Alliance, and Open Source operating system,
	XBasic, a recently GPL'd high-power version of basic, and Jaguar
	MMI, an Open Source project supported by the company I work for.
	(Creek Electric, Inc.). Industries: Feed milling, flour milling,
	wood chip plants, windshield plants, etc. Both me and the company I
	work for are in support of Open Source methodology when it comes to
	Industrial Control development and runtime tools. Creek Electric,
	Inc. (my employer during the day) has always been a big fan of
	giving the customer the source code to the PLC program (well, they
	COULD just download it from the PLC) and the source code for any
	MMI and other programming involved. We want our customers to
	continue to use us because we do good work, NOT because we have
	locked them into proprietary systems.
Contributions: Licensing discussions for MatPLC, and general BSing. I'll
	become more active when it comes time for a MMI system to start
	communicating with MatPLC - Jaguar MMI is the Open Source project
	that I'm spending most of my time with now, and when it comes time
	for interfaces between MatPLC and MMI systems, I've got a couple
	of things that I will probably be suggesting.
