<h2>Why are we moving?</h2>


<p>Recently, there has been growing concern within the LinuxPLC project and
in the wider community that our continued association with control.com may
compromise our independent, open-source status.

<p>These concerns are totally without foundation. However, as a community
project we depend on the unassailability of our position and our image in
the wider automation community.

<p>We therefore feel that it is prudent to move the project away from
control.com and to some other host, and continue development there. We have
selected <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>, the home of
hundreds of open source projects including well-known ones such as the
Python language or the icewm GUI manager.

<p>Our new web site is
<a href="http://mat.sourceforge.net">http://mat.sourceforge.net</a>


<p>A secondary benefit will be SourceForge's extensive expertise in open
source projects. From day 1 we will have facilities such as bug tracking,
facilities which we currently do not greatly need, but which will still
facilitate development.

<p>We would like to take this opportunity to thank Ken Crater, Dan Pierson
and the whole team at <a
href="http://www.control.com/control_com/">control.com</a> for
their hard work and support during the time we have been at their site. It
is thanks to this fruitful collaboration that the project is as far as it
is today and we hope it can continue into the future. We would also hope
that all of you will follow as it's <strong>your</strong> project and we
need you.

<p>Thank You

<p>The MatPLC team
