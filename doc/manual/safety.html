<h2>Safety</h2>

Safety of the system should be top priority of any design. Even the control
loop of a model railway can become dangerous if mains voltage finds its way
from the control system to the model's ground plane. 

<p>Safety should be taken into account from the earliest stage of design.
Safe design is always more complex, more difficult to design and more
costly to implement than plain vanila safety-ignorant one - but it is much
easier and cheaper if safety aspects are taken into account from the very
beginning. 

<p>Even where lives or injuries are not at stake, fail-safe design is
always preferrable (you do not want to have your garden watering system
stay ON indefinitely if the RCD breaker drops mains during watering...)

<p>MAT is currently still in development phase and as such it is not
suitable for safety sensitive applications.

<h3>Responsibility for Safety</h3>

Any system should be designed to be failure-safe if failure may cause
serious damage or injury.  Final responsibility for design - including
choice of hardware and software - always rests with actual designer,
implementor and user of the whole system.

<p>The designer, implementor and user should also make sure they comply
with any relevant statutory and common law requirements with regards to
safety, licensing, registration and permits and the like.

<p>Since you did not pay us (the developers of MatPLC), we cannot provide
any warranty or any other sort of statement as to the actual performance of
the software, its documentation or any other part.

<h3><a name="disclaimer">Formal Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED BY THE LICENCE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<h3>Obtaining warranty</h3>

It is permissible for third parties to offer warranty protection for this
software in exchange for a fee, or to offer warranty protection for a
particular system which uses MatPLC for a fee, and so on. This is always up
to the parties involved, and should be in writing to avoid
misunderstandings and unnecessary costly litigation.

<p>If you offer such warranties, please send us an e-mail so that we can
list you on our webpage.
