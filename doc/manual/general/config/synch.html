<h2>Configuration of synch</h2>

This section of the manual is not yet written. It will explain how to
configure the synch. Some of these are settings in the <tt>[PLC]</tt>
section, others are common to all modules, but they're all collected here
because they logically belong together.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

There is no "global cycle" in MatPLC unless the user specifically
configures one. By default, all modules run asynchronously, with semaphores
making sure they don't step on each others' toes.

<p>Explanation from a PLC background: the MatPLC reduces scan time at the
expense of latency - at the top/bottom of the scan, it simply uses the
latest available values rather than waiting for fresh ones. This is by
default.

<p>Using synch, the user can configure a global scan which interleaves
scans of the ladder with refreshing the I/O, classical PLC style.

<p>For modules like a modbus slave, one would normally leave it
asynchronous, serving requests as they come in.

<p>Similarly for any other modules that don't really belong in the global
cycle. Perhaps they might even have a mini-global-cycle of their own - for
instance, an I/O module and a corresponding DSP module might be synched
together but not to anything else.


<h3>Option 1: no synch configuration</h3>

Subsection not yet written.

<h3>Option 2: simple synch configuration</h3>

Subsection not yet written - see the comments in the example config file in
<tt>demo/basic_synch</tt>.

<h3>Option 3: advanced synch</h3>

Subsection not yet written; however, there is <a
href="synch_advanced_example.html">an example</a>, and some comments in the
other example config file in <tt>demo/basic_synch</tt>.
