<h1>Contributing to the MatPLC</h1>

There are three ways of contributing to the MatPLC, depending on your
coding skill and the degree to which you are familiar (or wish to become
familiar) with the MatPLC.

<h2>Testing</h2>

Testing, and reporting successes or failures, is the simplest way of
contributing to the MatPLC. The developers do their own testing, of course,
but sometimes we are a bit too close to the system to be able to test it
well, and in any case there's only so much hardware we have access to. The
only way to ensure robustness in a project such as this is for a large
number of people to test it with a reasonable variety of hardware.

<p>The documentation for this are the relevant sections of this manual,
skipping perhaps the section on custom modules. Please send your reports to
the mailing list, or submit bug reports to the SourceForge <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=29758&atid=397247">buglist</a>.

If you're reporting error messages from the MatPLC, please cut'n'paste - do
not paraphrase.

<h2>Modules</h2>

Writing modules is the second way of contributing. It requires some skill
in programming, and moderate knowledge of the MatPLC.

<p>Writing modules to contribute is no different from writing <a
href="../../custom/intro.html">custom modules</a>, so you'll need to read
that section of the manual. Since it is currently rather sparse, please ask
questions on the mailing list - we'll expand the manual as we answer them.

<p>These modules can be either I/O modules, interfacing the MatPLC to
particular hardware, or other modules, fulfilling some other useful
function. Notice that I/O modules have an additional library available to
them, which further reduces the amount of work required to write them.

<p>Alternately, you can write <strong>enhancements</strong> (or even just
bug fixes) for existing modules. This has the advantage that it is overall
a smaller task, since the bulk of the module will remain unchanged. Take a
look at the <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=29758&atid=397247">buglist</a>
on SourceForge if you would like to work on a module bugfix or enhancement;
the <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=29758&atid=397250">wishlist</a>
on the other hand contains ideas for pure enhancements and new modules.

<h2>Core</h2>

Contributing to the MatPLC core requires familiarity with the internals of
the MatPLC, and therefore an investment in time to learn them.

<p>Read the whole manual, and any other documentation in the doc directory,
in particular the <a href="http://mat.sf.net/lplc-article.txt">article
(doc/lplc-article.txt)</a>, and participate on the mailing list. Again, the
Sourceforge <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=29758&atid=397247">buglist</a>
and <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=29758&atid=397250">wishlist</a>
contain lists of bugs to be fixed and new features that would be desirable,
but it is by no means exhaustive. Discuss any proposed major changes on the
mat-devel mailing list before beginning them - some of the developers may
already be working on something similar.
