<h1>Modules</h1>

Modules are individual pieces of the MatPLC. Much like a real PLC, a
particular MatPLC installation consists of several modules, plugged into a
core (virtual backplane), working together to provide a useful application.
There are I/O modules, logic modules, user interface modules etc. Most of
this manual concerns the detailed instructions for one or another
particular kind of module.

<p>What modules are run is usually configured in the <a
href=../config/plc.html>PLC section of the config</a>. It's also possible
to start modules as separate programs, even when they aren't listed in the
config; the <a href="../../tools/plctest.html">plctest</a> tool is usually
started this way.

<p>Due to the high modularity of the MatPLC, most systems will consist of
several modules - perhaps between three and a dozen. Even the simplest of
demos typically have three or four modules.


<h3>Module groups</h3>

Modules are organized according to their function. This organization is
purely to simplify orientation; once modules are running, there is no
particular distinction between them (except that they do different jobs, of
course).

<dl>

<dt>Logic engines<dd>do the actual logic, decision making and calculation
of the MatPLC.</p>

<dt>I/O<dd>connect to the real world, or sometimes to a slave PLC over a
bus or other connection.</p>

<dt>HMI (or MMI)<dd>interact with the operator.</p>

</dl>

<h3>Module types</h3>

Modules come in three basic types.

<dl>

<dt>generic<dd>These modules come with the MatPLC and are used without
modification. An example is the DSP module - you specify in the
<code>matplc.conf</code> file that you wish to use it and specify the
inputs, outputs and tuning parameters for the PID loop (for instance).

<p>Most I/O modules also fall into this category.</p>

<dt>specific<dd>These modules do not directly come with the MatPLC.
Instead, they are created for a particular project using the tools
provided. An example is the <a href="../../logic/il.html">IL language</a>. You
write a PLC program in a file with the extension <code>.il</code>, which is
converted into a module before starting.

<p>The up-coming IEC 61131 translator will work the same way.</p>

<dt>custom-made<dd>This is the ultimate in specific modules; if none of the
existing modules is suitable for the job at hand, a completely new module
can be written in the C language. Such a module can do anything, but it is
much more difficult to write. It is essentially an extension of MAT
itself.</p>
