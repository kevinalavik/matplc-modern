<h1>System Requirements</h1>

Because of the high modularity of the MatPLC, you do not necessarily
need all the software listed below. No-one will ever use all the modules;
if you do not need a module, you do not need its requirements.

<h2>Common requirements</h2>

As well as a basic Linux system, compiling and running the MatPLC
system requires a few additional packages.

<p>When we make a binary release, we will list here the packages required to
run that release.

<p>To compile and run the MatPLC, you'll need gcc, libtool, make and
the other usual packages involved in compiling - header files, linkers,
etc.

<p>In addition, you will almost certainly need the <em>console-tools
development</em> package. The basic demo depends on this, and it's usually
not installed by default.

<p>Note: the libraries that come with <strong>Debian potato</strong> are
<u>missing</u> some of the functions that we use. One workaround is to
update parts of the system to <strong>Debian woody</strong>, which is the
new version of Debian - download the new <code>libc6-dev</code> and
whatever it depends on (let <code>apt</code> or <code>dselect</code> do it
for you).

<p>Perl is used in various places in the project; it's perhaps not strictly
necessary, but it'll be a hassle going without.

<h2>Module requirements</h2>

These are the requirements of the individual modules.

<dl>

<dt>doc<dd>To convert the manual to ps and pdf formats, you will need
html2ps, ghostscript, ps2pdf and preferably also the LaTeX hyphenation
files. The lca-2002 talk requires full LaTeX and netpbm, but it can be
downloaded off the webpage instead.</p>

<dt>logic/iec<dd>flex, bison</p>

<dt>mmi/curses<dd>curses</p>

<dt>mmi/hmi_gtk<dd>glade (with gnome support) development, gtkextra
library; the <code>widgetnamer</code>wizard also requires python (with
gtk)</p>

<dt>linuxkbd<dd>console-tools development (note that this module is used by
the basic demo)</p> 

<dt>io/comedi<dd>comedi library

</dl>

<h2>Summary</h2>

This section will contain the lists of packages for various distributions,
corresponding to the above requirements lists, which can simply be fed to
the appropriate installation tool (for instance, to Debian's <code>apt-get
install</code>).

<p>At present, it's rather incomplete.

<dl>

<dt>Debian<dd><code>console-tools-dev libcomedi-dev libgnome-dev libglade-gnome0-dev libgtkextra-dev</code>

</dl>
