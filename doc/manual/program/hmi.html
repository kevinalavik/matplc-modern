<h2>HMI</h2>

Every control system has to fulfil the requirements of its working cycle
but there are another two members of the "essential trio" - HMI and <a
href="../safety.html">Safety</a>. They are always present, even when
ignored by the author of the system.

<p>Even the simplest control systems have to provide some form of Human
Machine Interface. A few LEDs connected in parallel to output loads (or the
sound of clicking relays) are a crude form of HMI. For anything a bit more
complex - or anything that is to be used professionally - the HMI needs to
be designed carefully. For many designs it may be biggest part of the
project. It is also the part which sells, because it is visible.

<p>It often helps if the HMI layout and function is designed in parallel
with the control algorithm. The HMI has to be able to interface to the
operation itself, but the design of HMI often reveals some aspects of
operation which need to be controlled and which may not be otherwise
obvious at early stages of the project.

<p>A good HMI: <ul>

    <li>is easy to understand,

    <li>contributes to the safe and efficient running of the machine,
    
    <li>is self documenting,

    <li>includes on-line help (provides background information to
    operator),

    <li>provides at least some data logging (you will be the first to need
    it - for debugging),

    <li>may allow retrieving of logged data on screen or even replaying of
    logged cycle, and

    <li>provides troubleshooting functions, to facilitate tracing of
    problems - the plant technician should never need to go to lower levels
    of software simply to find out which sensor burned out.

</ul>

<p>A good HMI should provide on-screen all information needed for control
of operation, but low priority data may not be always visible. It is
important to prioritize data for complex systems. Failure scenarios in
particular have to be assessed, and the HMI should provide clear
descriptions of problems and preferably offer possible solutions to the
operator.
