<h2>Testing</h2>

<blockquote>I'm an idiot.. At least this one [bug] took about 5 minutes to
find.. <i>(Linus Torvalds in response to a bug report.)</i> </blockquote> 


<h3>Test rigs</h3>

<p>When writing modular programs, one of the important things is to be able
to test each section separately.

<p>This means that often you will have to construct test rigs for each
section that let you run it separately, making sure that it does what it is
expected to do. This can be a lot of work, but pays off in tracing down
problems - it's much easier to find a problem the earlier it gets
discovered.

<h3>Integration testing</h3>

<p>The other part of testing is ensuring that the sections work well
together.

<p>Again, it is not a good idea to simply throw all the sections together
and hope they work. As far as possible, always add one thing at a time.
This cuts down on tracing the source of problems, because it will usually
be connected with the section just added.

<p>If the program is big enough to have sub-sections and sub-subsections,
always integrate each section separately before putting them together.
Again, the idea is to simplify tracking down problems.

<h3>Risk analysis</h3>

<p>Under what circumstances can the software do damage to the machine or
the product it is manufacturing? How much will this damage cost to rectify?
These should form part of the test plan, including such techniques as
simulating such situations (or inducing them under controlled conditions),
to ensure that the software does indeed handle them satisfactorily.

<p>If there is any way in which the software could (through action or
inaction) cause a hazardous situation or harm a human, safety-critical
software specialists need to be brought in, or such situations removed
through hardware interlocks and the like.
