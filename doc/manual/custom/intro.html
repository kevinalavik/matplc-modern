<h1>Introduction to custom modules</h1>

<p>Most of the time, a combination of existing modules (generic and/or
specific) will fulfil the requirements of a project. However, sometimes
only a custom-made module will do. This chapter provides a short tutorial
on writing custom modules.

<p>Unless you need a custom module, you can safely skip this chapter.

<p>Custom modules can be written in several languages. They fall into two
broad groups, C and everything else.

<dl>

<dt>C<dd>C in a group of its own because it's the native language of the
MatPLC. As such, it allows access to 100% of the functionality as soon as
it appears in the MatPLC, and is a little more efficient (though with
current computers that generally doesn't matter).</p>

<dt>Everything else<dd>Writing C is a specialist job, and sometimes it's
better to write in a more user-friendly language such as <a
href="../lang/python.html">python</a> (sort of like BASIC or VB but about
three decades more modern). If you are already using one of these languages
elsewhere in the project, you can also connect directly from there to the
MatPLC without going through an intermediary.

<p>If you decide to use one of the other languages, you should still skim
the chapter on C, as the other languages may be incomplete (please file a
bug or ask on the mailing list if there's a function there that you want to
use from one of the other languages), and in any case they generally follow
the same layout and structure.

</dl>

<p>Another purpose of this chapter is to explain somewhat the workings of
the supplied generic and specific modules. The modules supplied with the
MatPLC work exactly the same way as custom modules. Currently they're all
written in <a href="native.html">native C</a>.

<h2>Contributing modules to the project</h2>

<p>If you write an interesting custom module that you think other people
would find useful, you can contribute it to the project. There's no
difference between writing a custom module and writing a module to
contribute.

<p>Just about the only requirement is that the module has to be under the
<a href="../appendix/gpl.html">GPL licence</a>. We may make some
adjustments to the module to make it fit better with our intended
architecture or project organization, of course, or merge it with an
existing module; but if it's something that people would generally find
useful, we'd love to have it in the CVS!

<p>For other ways of contributing to the project, please see the <a
href="../general/contribute/intro.html">Contributing to the MatPLC</a>
chapter.
