Reason: This document explains how to add sections to the manual so that
they show up officially.

Instructions:

  1. Create the new HTML manual pages as necessary. Use existing pages for
  templates - this will help maintain consistency. The directory structure
  should generally reflect the main directory structure.

  2. Add links to the pages in MATPLC/doc/manual/index.html manually.

  3. Use "./autolink" in this directory. It reads through index.html, and
  changes the links in the individual pages appropriately. For it to work,
  the links at the top and the bottom of the page must be enclosed between
  the comments "<!--autolink-->" and "<!--/autolink-->". The links are
  added between them if they're missing, so all you need to add is
  "<!--autolink--><!--/autolink-->" and it'll work.

      Note: this was different before 28.12.2004; this way is better for
      Mozilla Composer (and probably other pretty-formatting editors).

  If you're having trouble with step 3, just check it in as-is and drop an
  e-mail to Jiri <jiri@baum.com.au>

  4. Update all the files in the directory to the CVS tree.

The changes will show up on the webpage within eight hours (it is
automatically updated three times a day).
