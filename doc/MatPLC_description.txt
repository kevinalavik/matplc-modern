The MatPLC is an open source solution to the closed, proprietary world of PC
 based controls.  It is released under the Gnu General Public License (GPL) 
which means that it is freely available to the public.  It is our intention 
that this be a publicly owned project, and that the public is free to use, 
modify, extend, and do whatever it is that they want with the system.
Anyone who feels that they are able to contribute to the project is more
than welcome to join in.  There are no contracts, secret agreements,
licensing, or other constraints found in most of the competing systems.  
The problem with existing packages is that they tie you to a single vendor, 
force upgrades to keep tech support, and are, with a few exceptions, 
strictly Windows based.

One advantage of Linux is that it can be custom-tooled by removing all
components that are not necessary for performing the task at hand.  If an
audio player, web browser or even the whole graphical interface is not
required, it can be removed.  It is possible to get a linux system
trimmed down to fit onto a floppy disk.  This customizability means that
you can get excellent performance out of your hardware by eliminating
anything that is not needed to perform your control task.  If this is not
sufficient, the MatPLC is designed to be POSIX compliant, so it will be
portable to other unix variations, including ones that support hard real
time such as QNX, RTLinux, etc.

By releasing the MatPLC under the same GNU General Public License (GPL) that
Linux is released under, we can guarantee that the integrator and user will be
able to use, update, and support their system in perpetuity, if they desire.
Unlike current solutions, that stop providing support for their system once a
new version is released, the GPL ensures that nobody will be forced to make
drastic changes to their system just to continue to be allowed to use it.
Anyone who has gone through the process of migrating a HMI or PC control system
from Windows 95 to Windows NT, or even from one version of the HMI to the next,
knows the problems involved.  But the only compelling reason to do this in the
first place is because the vendor no longer supports the system that was
originally sold. This is what we are trying to correct with the MatPLC.  By using
the GPL, anyone can continue to use whatever version they like.

One of the design decisions that was made early in the project's life was to keep
 the entire system as modular as possible.  In this way, the final project will
consist of only those modules that are required to perform the desired operation.

The PLC core includes a shared memory manager that controls the access
to the common data table.  I/O, analog signals, integer and floating point 
variables, etc are all accessed through this memory manager.  By controlling 
when each module synchronizes its data to the central table, we can 
ensure that each process is working from a consistent data-set, and updates 
are precisely predictable.

Synchronization is also maintained through the PLC core.  Modules can be
configured to simply run one after the other in lock stepped scan fashion, or
complex relationships can be configured with modules running independent of
each other, using a modified petri-net control design.

Today, the MatPLC is approaching Beta-testing stages.  We have some I/O 
modules, most recently a Modbus master.  We also have support for Hilscher
cards (www.hilscher.com), which include DeviceNet, ASI, profibus support 
and many other fieldbus networks.  We have the system core, including 
the shared memory manager.  A system configurator is in development, 
and We also have an instruction list logic engine operational, and an 
HMI that is well underway.  We are in the process of absorbing a ladder 
logic editor / solver into the project, and merging with a sister project.  
This is one of the most powerful aspects of open source development.  
There are other projects out there, being worked on by other people.  
When we can get together with them, the ability to tie both of our projects 
together into one makes for a very powerful development method.  Rather 
than hiding from others, and trying to keep what we are doing a secret, 
we can pool our resources, and everyone wins.

Because of the design of the PC, the I/O control is best done using a
fieldbus network.  One of our biggest challenges has been to convince the
parties that control the fieldbus standards that they should allow us to support
their protocols.  Many of them simply do not wish to allow their networks to be
used in an open system environment, but want to keep them locked away from broad
support.  We have gotten around this problem somewhat by using hardware that 
implements the protocols in firmware, which lets us use the license from the
hardware vendor to make our use legal, but it would be far better for the end
user if we could implement these protocols natively.

Our hope is that once we release a truly open system using Modbus, and I/O from
other vendors that have helped us, some of the remaining networks will come on 
board with us.  We are also working with a supplier of a rack based PC system
that lives in a PLC-style chassis.  This is a system on the market today, and we
are trying to get Linux to operate on that platform.  That would open up a wide
array of I/O options to us, plus give us a semi-standard hardware platform to
back it up.

Another supporter of our project has been SixNet (www.sixnetio.com).  Their
upcoming Linux RTU will be available with a small linux kernel embedded.  
This devices ability to handle large amounts of I/O makes it an exceptional
replacement for small PLC's, where more connectivity is needed than what is
available on the Micro PLC's today.  SixNet has promised us a library that 
will allow us to communicate to their I/O devices.  the library will be GPL
compliant.  This is no small step for a system vendor.  We hope that others
will see the positive results of this move, and come on board as well.
