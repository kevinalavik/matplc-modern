The MatPLC is an open source solution to the closed, proprietary world of PC
 based controls.  The goal of the MatPLC is to offer users a PC based control
system that is truly open, extendable, and maintanable by the user.  The problem
with existing packages is that they tie you to a single vendor, force upgrades
to keep tech support, and are, with a few exceptions, strictly windows based.

We feel that the windows based solution is less than optimal because windows is
designed to be a consumer grade operating system.  This leads to problems caused
by things like audio players, web browsers, and other consumer oriented
components that are deeply embedded into the operating system.  These components
are all vying for the processors time, and are all executing code that can cause
slowdowns, hang ups, or security problems, with no possible method of removing
them.

Linux, by comparison, can be custom tooled by removing all components that are
not necessary for performing the task at hand.  It is possible to get a linux
system trimmed down to fit onto a floppy disk.  This customizability means that
you can get excellent performance out of your hardware by eliminating anything
that is not needed to perform your control task.

By releasing the MatPLC under the same GNU General Public License (GPL) that
Linux is released under, we can guarantee that the integrator and user will be
able to use, update, and support their system in perpetuity, if they desire.
Unlike current solutions, that stop providing support for their system once a
new version is released, the GPL insures that nobody will be forced to make
drastic changes to their system just to continue to be allowed to use it.
Anyone who has gone through the process of migrating a HMI or PC control system
from Windows 95 to Windows NT, or even from one version of the HMI to the next,
knows the problems involved.  But the only compelling reason to do this in the
first place is because the vendor no longer supports the system that was
originally sold. This is what we are trying to correct with the MatPLC.  By using
the GPL, anyone can continue to use whatever version they like.

One of the design decisions that was made early in the projects life was to keep
 the entire system as modular as possible.  In this way, the final project will
consist of only those parts that are required to perform the desired operation.
A shared memory manager controls most of the inter-process communication.  I/O,
analog signals, integer and floating point variables, etc are all accessed
through this memory manager.  By controlling when each process synchronizes its
process to the central table, we can insure that each process is working from a
consistent data-set, and updates are precisely predictable.

Synchronization is also maintained through the PLC core.  Components can be
configured to simply run one after the other in lock stepped scan fashion, or
complex relationships can be configured with processes running independent of
each other, using a modified petri-net control design.

Today, the MatPLC is approaching Beta-testing stages.  We have some I/O modules,
most recently a Modbus master.  We have the system core, including the shared
memory manager.  A system configurator is in development, and we are in the
process of absorbing a ladder logic editor / solver into the project.  We also
have an instruction list logic engine operational, and an HMI that is well
underway.

Things to finish before we are ready to release it for beta testing include
finishing the items listed above, plus trying to gain more support for I/O
networks.  Becuase of the design of the PC, the I/O control is best done using a
fieldbus network.  One of our biggest challenges has been to convince the
parties that control the fieldbus standards that they should allow us to support
their protocols.  Many of them simply do not wish to allow their networks to be
used in an open system environment, but want to keep them locked away from broad
support.

Our hope is that once we release a truly open system using Modbus, and I/O from
other vendors that have helped us, some of the remaining networks will come on 
board with us.  We are also working with a supplier of a rack based PC system
that lives in a PLC-style chassis.  This is a system on the market today, and we
are trying to get Linux to operate on that platform.  That would open up a wide
array of I/O options to us, plus give us a semi-standard hardware platform to
back it up.
